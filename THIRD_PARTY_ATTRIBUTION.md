# Third-Party Attribution

snesrecomp incorporates the following third-party software.

## PSXRecomp screen-color models

`runner/src/snes/color_lut.{c,h}` adapts the present-time screen-color LUT from
`mstan/psxrecomp` revision
`d7815862e18ef939e5e6e5c6947f8c29667982d5`, pinned by
`mstan/MegaManX6Recomp` when inspected on 2026-07-21. The relevant files were
byte-identical at PSXRecomp revision
`d2006e02a3001495b1eedf2c1cc965d23c0de38f`, pinned by
`mstan/Tomba2Recomp` at that time.

The C color-science lineage derives from JRickey/gba-recomp revision
`de4edf59b872d887046d6a3b005e2df551b6d44c` and is licensed MIT OR
Apache-2.0. PSXRecomp's C adaptation and screen-model parameters are licensed
under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0. Exact provenance, local adaptations, and
complete license texts are under `third_party/psxrecomp_color_lut/`.

## Native analyzer performance inspiration

Derrick Gold's independent Go port of the snesrecomp recompiler demonstrated
that moving the Python pipeline to a compiled implementation could deliver an
approximately 25x speedup. That result prompted the production native-analyzer
work in this repository.

- Project: https://github.com/DerrickGold/ar-recomp
- Go migration commit: https://github.com/DerrickGold/ar-recomp/commit/ae3d2d1ffaa87281241bb1a2822d5b3dde35ca96

No source from the Go implementation is incorporated into `recompiler-rs/`.
The Rust code's implementation foundation and provenance are documented below.

## Native analyzer foundation

The Rust instruction decoder, cfg parser, and ROM mapping foundation under
`recompiler-rs/` originated in Colin Curtin's `perplexes/snesrecomp`
`feat/superfx-gsu/recompiler-rs` work and has since been reduced to the native
analysis boundary, updated for the current Python semantics, and extended with
the whole-program fixed point and production integration.

## ares — Capcom Cx4 / Hitachi HG51B S169 coprocessor

`runner/src/snes/cx4.{c,h}` is an instruction-level emulation of the Hitachi
HG51B S169 DSP that Capcom packaged as the Cx4 (used only by Mega Man X2 and
Mega Man X3). It is ported from **ares**, which is **ISC-licensed** —
permissive, notice-only, no field-of-use restriction.

- Upstream: https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares
- Files of origin: `ares/component/processor/hg51b/*` (core: registers,
  instruction decode, instruction semantics, cache/DMA/bus control) and
  `ares/sfc/coprocessor/hitachidsp/memory.cpp` (SNES-side address decode and
  IO register map)
- License: ISC (see below)

This is the faithful LLE floor: the DSP fetches and executes the game's own Cx4
program out of cartridge ROM. Any future host-side Cx4 shortcut must be a
**gated optimization layered on top of it**, authored from this core's observed
behavior — never a substitute for it.

### Derivation / modifications

- C++ → C11. ares is written against nall's bit-precise integer types
  (`n1`/`n5`/`n8`/`n15`/`n24`/`n48`) where every assignment silently truncates
  to the declared width. That masking is load-bearing arithmetic — the
  accumulator is 24 bits, the program counter is 8 bits and *wraps* to advance
  the instruction cache page, the multiplier is 48 bits. C has no such types, so
  every width is enforced by an explicit named mask (`M24`, `M15`, …) and the
  porting hazard is documented at the top of `cx4.c`.
- ares' 65536-entry `std::function` dispatch table (built at construction) is
  replaced by a two-level `switch` on the opcode's top 6 bits, sub-switching on
  the top 8 where the encoding requires it. Same mapping, expressed directly.
- Arithmetic shift right and sign-extension are written out explicitly rather
  than relying on implementation-defined signed `>>`.
- `ROR` by 0 or 24 is special-cased; the reference only survives that shift
  width by relying on 32-bit truncation.
- ares runs the DSP as a scheduler `Thread` synchronized against the CPU. Here
  it is a pull model: `cx4_sync(master_clock)` converts elapsed SNES master
  cycles into 20 MHz Cx4 cycles (carrying the remainder so the ratio does not
  drift) and runs the core until the budget is spent, wired into the engine's
  existing `cart_sync_coprocessors` seam. An idle fast path collapses the
  budget when the core is halted with nothing pending — exactly equivalent,
  minus millions of no-op calls.
- Added observability in keeping with this project's ring-buffer policy: an
  always-on ring of DSP program starts, a retired-instruction count, an
  `RDROM` hit counter, and a loud one-shot diagnostic when `RDROM` executes
  without firmware loaded. Exposed as the debug-server `cx4_state` command.
- The `disassembler.cpp` / `debugger.cpp` components were not ported.

### Firmware (NOT included, and not ours to ship)

The HG51B S169 carries a 1024-entry × 24-bit internal data ROM — a
reciprocal/division table — which is **not** part of the game ROM. `cx4.rom`,
3072 bytes. It is Capcom/Hitachi data; this project does not redistribute it,
and `.gitignore` refuses it. `cx4_load_firmware()` searches
`$SNESRECOMP_CX4_ROM`, `./cx4.rom`, `./firmware/cx4.rom`, and the game ROM's
directory, and reports loudly rather than silently computing on zeros.

Measured on Mega Man X2's boot self-test: the Cx4 program reads **all 1024**
data-ROM entries. The firmware is genuinely required, not optional.

## LakeSnes — 65816 CPU core

`runner/src/snes/interp816.{c,h}`, the 65816 interpreter backing the
interpreter-fallback tier (see `docs/MULTI_TIER.md`), is derived from the CPU
core of **LakeSnes** by angelo_wf.

- Upstream: https://github.com/angelo-wf/lakesnes
- License: MIT

### Derivation / modifications

Recovered from `runner/src/snes/cpu.c` as it existed at commit `9de9855^` —
the snesrecomp tree's original LakeSnes adaptation, before the unused
interpreter was ripped on 2026-04-20 — then re-vendored for the
interpreter-fallback tier with:

- symbols namespaced `cpu_*` / `Cpu` → `interp816_*` / `Interp816` so the core
  coexists with the legacy `Cpu` debug shadow (`runner/src/snes/cpu.{c,h}`);
- the hardwired `snes_cpuRead` / `snes_cpuWrite` bus replaced with a
  caller-supplied callback bus (so the production adapter can route memory
  through the AOT `cpu_read8` / `cpu_write8` HLE bus);
- snesrecomp debug instrumentation removed (`pc_hist` / `DumpCpuHistory` and
  the top-of-`doOpcode` assert tripwire);
- `WAI` restored to stock behavior (`waiting = true`, was an assert);
- `BRK` routed to the `interp816_opcode_hook` bridge seam.

The exact transform is reproducible: `git show 9de9855^:runner/src/snes/cpu.c`,
then the renames + seam edits described above. The vendored core is validated
by `tests/interp816/` (directed opcode harness).
